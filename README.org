# STORY-TEMPLATE-VERSION: 4.3.0

* Update landing page

  - Users _expects_ a presentation of NNotes _so that_ they can understand under
    1 minute of attention what they can earn from investing (time, money) in
    NNotes.



*** Definitions

    - <<dropbox>>: [[https://www.dropbox.com/][Dropbox]]



** Init State

   - NNotes does not have a landing page that meet users expectations.



** Problem

   - Users won't invest anything in NNotes if they don't understand what they
     will earn from that investment.



** End State

   - NNotes has a landing page similar to the one of [[dropbox][Dropbox]].



*** Rationale

    - We beleive that simplicity wins anyway...
