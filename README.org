** Init State

   - NNotes does not have a landing page that meet users expectations.



** Problem

   - Users won't invest anything in NNotes if they don't understand what they
     will earn from that investment.



** End State

   - NNotes has a landing page similar to the one of [[dropbox][Dropbox]].



*** Rationale

    - We believe that simplicity wins anyway...
